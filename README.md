**Project Summary:**

**Title:** Développement d'un système BI pour la gestion des données cliniques des maladies cardiaques avec Angular (Clinical Data Management System for Heart Diseases)

**Authors:** Imrane El Mehdi, El Mehdi Karkache, Aya Amarass

**Supervisor:** Prof. Naoual Boukil

**Course:** Business Intelligence, Advanced Web Frameworks

**Introduction:**
In fulfillment of our fourth-year Computer Engineering curriculum, we undertook a significant project integrating Advanced Frameworks and Business Intelligence modules. Our aim was to develop a robust BI system to collect, analyze, and present key metrics related to heart diseases. Leveraging Angular, a versatile web application development platform, we crafted a user-friendly interface to streamline access to clinical data.

**Problem Statement and Solutions:**
The complexity and diversity of clinical data pertaining to heart diseases necessitate the implementation of an effective Business Intelligence (BI) system. To address this, we utilized multidimensional star schema modeling, established a DataWarehouse for centralized data integration, and automated data collection through an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process. Angular was employed to design and develop an interactive dashboard for data visualization and analysis.

**Technologies Used:**
- Angular
- MySQL
- Spring Boot
- Power BI
- Talend

**BI and Angular Integration:**
The combination of BI for complex data management and decision-making, coupled with Angular's interactive features, empowers public health decision-makers with comprehensive insights, fostering informed decisions and proactive healthcare strategies.

**Conclusion:**
Our project's culmination results in a powerful solution for managing clinical data related to heart diseases. By leveraging BI principles alongside Angular's dynamic capabilities, our system enables tailored interventions and improved preventive measures against heart ailments. We collaborated efficiently, delivering a comprehensive dashboard solution and informed decisions, reflecting our dedication to advancing healthcare through technology.
